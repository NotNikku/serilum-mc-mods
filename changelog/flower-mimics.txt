Changelog:
Flower Mimics
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flower-mimics

=========
v1.1: Modded flowers are now loaded into the config, but the target mimic entity is left empty.
This prevents unwanted behaviour with functional modded flower blocks.
They can still be transformed, but would have to be added manually.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of Flower Mimics.
